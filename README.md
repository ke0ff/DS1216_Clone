# DS1216_Clone
Clone of the DS1216 SmartWatch socket with external/replaceable battery<p>
This is a PCB which mimics the original DS1216 module.  The battery is external and can be connectorized.<br>
This provides a viable path for products which use the SmartWatch to continue to operate for decades to come.<br>
Ideally, the DS1216 IC is salvaged from an existing smartwatch and resoldered onto the new PCB.  A new crystal,<br>
socket, and header are needed to complete the assembly.  A connector can be used for the battery, or it may be<br>
hard-wired to the connector pads.
<p>
Currently, only the "E" and "C" SmartWatch modules are supported here.  Other versions may come later.<br>

The .zip archives contain the design source files as well as the outputs (Gerber, NCDrill, PDF schem, & BOM docs).
